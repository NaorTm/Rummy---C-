# Rummy Card Logic (C++)

Core data structures for a Rummy-style card game. Includes card objects, Unicode suit rendering, and stack-based deck operations.

## Features
- Card model with suit/value
- Stack-based deck with push/pop and shuffle
- Unicode suit rendering for console output

## Build
This repo contains the card/deck logic. Compile with a C++ compiler:

```sh
g++ *.cpp -o rummy
```

## Notes
This project focuses on the data structures; a full game loop can be added on top of it.
